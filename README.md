# Dog Wiki

A small responsive web page that generates a short wiki-like item for several dog breeds. Each item is created dynamically in JavaScript and contains:

- breed name
- a random picture of the breed (fetched from the Dog API)
- a short summary fetched from Wikipedia (REST API)

Files
- `index.html` — HTML5 entry page (bare bones; the content is generated by JavaScript)
- `style.css` — mobile-first styling with a media query at 600px for desktop layout
- `script.js` — creates the `.wiki-item` elements using `createElement`/`appendChild`, fetches images from `dog.ceo` and summaries from Wikipedia.

How to run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use File → Open). No build tools required.
2. To preview responsive layouts, open DevTools and use the responsive device toolbar (Windows: Ctrl+Shift+M).

Notes
- The project uses only vanilla JavaScript and the Fetch API (promise-based `then/catch`) to avoid transpiler/runtime dependencies.
- If you want to host it on GitHub Pages: enable Pages in the repository Settings and select branch `main` / folder `root`.

APIs used
- Dog API: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
- Wikipedia REST API: https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/
